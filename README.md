# Java Chess
Play chess in your terminal vs simple MinMax Algorithm.

# Motivation
Was interested in different components of making a chess game, beginning with the core engine. Afterwards added an AI player to 
compete with.

# How to use?
  - ## Install the package.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Stefunga/ChessAI
    ```
  - ## Compile in terminal or IDE
    ```
    javac Board.java	
    javac MinMax.java	
    javac moveVerify.java
    javac Game.java

    javac Test.java
    ```
  - ## And run
